## Considerations
- Using Typescript, node.js and React is a plus
- The frameworks and libraries is up to your choice
- We will look for error handling, but we are not expecting all edge cases to be covered
- Using a responsive design is a plus
- Adding tests is not mandatory, but is a big plus
- Provide a Readme to explain how to run the project and how to run the tests (in case they are present)
